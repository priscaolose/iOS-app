# My First iOS App!

This is my first iOS app project! Below are some ideas for how I plan to improve and enhance the app in the future.

### Ideas to Improve the App:
- Improve the UI by experimenting with different fonts, colors, and background styles.
- Explore the use of additional UI elements, such as image views and text fields.
- Implement a feature to change the color of the text based on user interaction.

### App Idea: "Eczema Care"

For my app idea, I would like to create an app called **Eczema Care**. This app will help people with eczema manage their condition and track their symptoms. The app would allow users to:

- **Track flare-ups** by logging symptoms such as redness, itching, and dryness, while also monitoring potential triggers.
- **Create personalized skincare routines** based on their skin type and the severity of symptoms.
- **Access educational content** about managing eczema, including product recommendations, lifestyle tips, and dietary advice.
- **Receive reminders** for moisturizing and taking prescribed medications.

One of the key features would be a **photo journal**, allowing users to track their skin's progress over time and share these updates with healthcare providers for a more personalized treatment approach.

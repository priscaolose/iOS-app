my first ios app!
Some ideas to improve the app are:

- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Iplement a way to change the color of the text as well

App Idea: "Eczema Care"
For my app idea, I would like to create an app called Eczema Care that helps people with eczema manage their condition and track their symptoms. The app would allow users to:

Track flare-ups by logging symptoms like redness, itching, and dryness, and monitor any triggers.
Create personalized skincare routines based on their skin type and severity of symptoms.
Access educational content on managing eczema, including product recommendations, lifestyle tips, and diet advice.
Get reminders for moisturizing and taking prescribed medications.
A potential feature would be to include a photo journal to track skin changes over time, and the ability to share the journal with healthcare providers for more personalized treatment.
